Ibi is a talented young trouble maker, that likes all kinds of unusual expressions. There more off mainstream and the more unique the most atractive and valuable. She has gone her way to create her own unusual mode of expression, using poetry, music, drawing, paing and photography. The voice that comes out of her creative art amalgams her cultural background with a profound understanding of the human psyche and the societal strings that move an individual without selfcontrol. 

Ibi was born in Mexico, and brought to Philadelphia at the young age of 2. Growing in the northern suburbs has familiarized and taken the american culture as a native, but never forgeting her roots. I love for the Mexican folklore and food, and that something that when ever she goes back to visit makes her feel like the USA it is so far away, and although still familiar, there is a feeling she has much left to explore.

Sensible, inquisitive, explosive and thoughtful; immigrant: in papers. All those voices can be heard in her art.
